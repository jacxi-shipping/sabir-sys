## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### Problem: Pashto text shows as boxes (□□□)

**Solution:** Install Pashto fonts
- **Windows:** Download "Noto Sans" from Google Fonts
- **Linux:** `sudo apt-get install fonts-noto`
- **macOS:** Pashto is already supported

### Problem: Layout didn't change to RTL

**Solution:** 
1. Close the application completely
2. Reopen it
3. The RTL layout should now be active

### Problem: Some text still in English

**This is normal!** Some technical terms and data are kept in English for clarity:
